# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains code for a movie recommendation system implemented in Python. The recommendation system uses a dataset of movies and their attributes to suggest similar movies based on user input.

## Dataset

The recommendation system utilizes the following datasets:

- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains information about movies such as title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew, etc.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains credits information for the movies, including cast and crew details.

Make sure to place these datasets in the same directory as the code file before running the program.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy` (version X.X.X): A library for numerical computations in Python.
- `pandas`
